Hello!

This is one of my first websites I made, using HTML & CSS. Although it's cringey, I'm proud of how far I came in my development journey and it's good to look back on you first projects.

I did not include the sound portion which would be recordings of me reading the paragrpahs and would be playable under each paragraph but I did include video of gameplay.



Side note:
I have since quit the game, and will never make a website like this again. Nonetheless please enjoy.
